![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-t-bone?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-t-bone/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-t-bone)

This nerdpack serves as a boilerplate for developers building on the New Relic One platform. In order to use this layout for your next project, follow the **Getting started88 instructions below, and then replace the dummy content in `nerdlet/index.js` with your content.

#### What's included?

- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to implement this layout.
- CSS to improve the styling and provide some basic UX help.
- Utility classes for things like making an element full width or full height.

## Usage

This Nerdpack is a boilerplate for applications built on New Relic One; the best way to use it is to clone the repo whenever you're ready to start a new project. The idea is that the code that determines the layout has already been written, so you can replace the content inside of each section (toolbar, sidebar, primary-content) with the content that you have in mind for your project.
